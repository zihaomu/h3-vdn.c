# h3.c

Native MiniMax-H3 inference for Apple Silicon and native OpenVDN MiniMax-H3
inference for AMD ROCm on Linux.

The original MiniMax-H3 path supports prompt-to-video/audio, first/last-frame
conditioning, and ordered Ref2VA image/video/audio references end to end on
Metal. The OpenVDN path loads the Diffusers-format `h3-base` plus
`stage-dmd-step-250`, merges its default and turbo LoRA adapters, streams all 50
hybrid-attention blocks through one discrete GPU, and decodes synchronized video
and audio on HIP.

| Path | Host/backend | Prompt input | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| MiniMax-H3 FL2VA/Ref2VA | macOS, Metal | Raw text with optional media references | End to end |
| OpenVDN `stage-dmd-step-250` | Linux, ROCm/HIP | Pre-encoded prompt safetensors | End-to-end MVP validated |

## OpenVDN on Linux/ROCm

### Requirements and pinned release

The current HIP port is validated on x86_64 Ubuntu 24.04, ROCm 7.2, and an AMD
Radeon AI PRO R9700 (`gfx1201`, 31.9 GiB). The preflight requires at least one
`gfx1201` device,
30 GB of VRAM, 16 GB of currently available host memory, and 100 GB of free disk
space. The full pinned model snapshot occupies about 87.4 GB on disk.

The helper scripts pin both upstream inputs:

```text
OpenVDN code:  b8cb28fbfca0266d1c7742a9f25ab8b58191de97
Model:         OpenVDN/vdn-minimax-h3
Model revision: 18be6bcc4ee72585eee322ba28b5ccac2cf85ef0
```

Install project-local Hugging Face and FFmpeg tools, then run the environment
check. The bootstrap writes only under `.tools/`; it does not replace the host
Python environment or system FFmpeg.

```sh
scripts/bootstrap_vdn_tools.sh
. scripts/use_vdn_tools.sh
scripts/check_vdn_env.sh
```

Download and verify the pinned model snapshot:

```sh
scripts/download_vdn_model.sh models/vdn-minimax-h3
```

Model weights, local tools, generated media, converted prompts, and volatile
baseline reports are ignored by Git.

### Prepare a prompt

The OpenVDN checkpoint does not contain the Qwen3-VL-32B prompt encoder. The
native MVP therefore accepts an externally encoded prompt rather than raw `-p`
text. Obtain the pinned upstream examples and convert one of its `prompts/*.pt`
files to the small, auditable input format used by this runtime:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/OpenVDN/vdn-minimax-h3.git \
  ../vdn-minimax-h3-upstream
git -C ../vdn-minimax-h3-upstream checkout \
  b8cb28fbfca0266d1c7742a9f25ab8b58191de97

python3 scripts/convert_vdn_prompt.py \
  ../vdn-minimax-h3-upstream/prompts/example_0.pt \
  models/vdn-minimax-h3/prompts/example_0.safetensors
```

The converter uses only the Python standard library, never unpickles the `.pt`
archive, and validates the released BF16 `[800,5120]` embeddings and I64 `[800]`
token tags before writing safetensors.

To encode a new text prompt, first use the pinned upstream OpenVDN
`src/inference/encode_prompt.py` environment, then convert its `.pt` output with
the same command. Direct raw-text VDN encoding inside this binary is not yet
implemented.

### Build, inspect, and generate

Linux selects HIP by default; it can also be requested explicitly:

```sh
make BACKEND=hip -j16
./h3 --list-devices
./h3 --info \
  --model-dir models/vdn-minimax-h3/h3-base \
  --vdn-checkpoint models/vdn-minimax-h3/stage-dmd-step-250
```

Source the local tool environment in every new shell before generating media,
then run the end-to-end correctness workload:

```sh
. scripts/use_vdn_tools.sh

./h3 --device 0 \
  --model-dir models/vdn-minimax-h3/h3-base \
  --vdn-checkpoint models/vdn-minimax-h3/stage-dmd-step-250 \
  --prompt-embeds models/vdn-minimax-h3/prompts/example_0.safetensors \
  --width 64 --height 32 --frames 56 --seed 0 \
  --output outputs/vdn-cli-smoke.mp4
```

The 64x32 canvas is deliberately a control-flow and resource-lifetime smoke
test, not a visual-quality target. Width and height must be multiples of 32.
The validated run performs eight actual model evaluations, each streaming all
50 blocks and their effective base/default/turbo weights. If `--steps` is
omitted, the CLI reads `8` from this checkpoint; an explicitly mismatched value
fails before loading the large weights.

Generation writes both the requested MP4 and
`<output>.inference.json`. The record contains the fixed model revision,
checkpoint and prompt paths, backend/device, seed, NFE, 12/3 video/audio shifts,
tensor geometry, peak GPU allocation, and phase timings.

The validated seed-0 smoke result is:

```text
video: H.264, 56 frames, 64x32, 24 fps, 2.333333 s
audio: AAC, stereo, 32000 Hz, 2.325000 s
MP4:   73528 bytes
SHA256: 7a447fe6f63697ad1bbb2df8a74f385b432ce3a1d5855caee5f8c1531a955c5b
peak GPU allocation: 9706357024 bytes (about 9.04 GiB)
```

This result was reproduced byte-for-byte by both the lower-level end-to-end
test and the public CLI. All 56 decoded video frames had distinct frame hashes;
the decoded audio measured -27.5 dB mean and -14.5 dB peak, ruling out a frozen
or silent container.

The E2E test also accepts `VDN_E2E_FRAMES`, `VDN_E2E_LATENT_H`,
`VDN_E2E_LATENT_W`, `VDN_E2E_AUDIO_LATENTS`, and `VDN_E2E_NFE` while retaining
the fast 64x32 defaults. The stable-release production gate uses:

```sh
HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 \
VDN_E2E_FRAMES=56 VDN_E2E_LATENT_H=32 VDN_E2E_LATENT_W=32 \
VDN_E2E_AUDIO_LATENTS=93 VDN_E2E_NFE=8 \
./h3_vdn_e2e_tests \
  models/vdn-minimax-h3/h3-base \
  models/vdn-minimax-h3/stage-dmd-step-250 \
  models/vdn-minimax-h3/prompts/example_0.safetensors \
  outputs/vdn-e2e-production.mp4
```

Two consecutive production runs completed in 486.49 and 487.20 seconds. Both
produced the same 2,315,918-byte, 56-frame 512x512 MP4 with SHA-256
`ee267508d2c988629811ce86db8d6ac7a1a8291957b792583348dc0be90eea43`.
The denoised latent, decoded F32 video, PCM, RGB24, and final MP4 hashes all
matched across runs; all 56 decoded frames were distinct and the audio measured
-23.5 dB mean / -9.8 dB peak.

With `--profile`, the HIP backend also reports weight-read/H2D throughput,
command wait time, allocation/dispatch counters, and GPU event time for linear,
SDPA, VDN solve, and VDN scan operations. On `gfx1201`, VDN window attention
uses a wave32 kernel with precomputed window bounds and a D=128 specialization;
set `H3_VDN_SCALAR_SDPA=1` to restore the bitwise oracle. At the real
512x512/56-frame token geometry, caching the invariant query values and jumping
directly over masked video-key gaps reduced the crossed standalone median from
0.6613 to 0.6401 seconds (-3.2%). The current kernel broadcasts the reduced
score once and updates identical online-softmax state in every lane, replacing
two scale shuffles and a lane-0-only branch without changing arithmetic order.
Five crossed standalone groups reduced the median again from 0.6386 to 0.4153
seconds (-35.0%); all hashes remained exact. `H3_VDN_RELOAD_QUERY=1`,
`H3_VDN_SCAN_MASK=1`, and `H3_VDN_LANE0_SOFTMAX=1` restore the corresponding
legacy behaviors for A/B diagnosis. On real weights, the latest 50-layer A/B
reduced median SDPA event time from 18.834 to 16.372 seconds (-13.1%) and
external wall time from 35.51 to 33.00 seconds (-7.1%), with the same 4.969 GiB
peak, output hashes, and 66.818 GiB weight payload. This is a single-NFE compute
acceptance, not a production-resolution visual-quality benchmark. The method,
exact inputs, rejected candidates, and next priorities are recorded in
[`doc/VDN_ROCM_OPTIMIZATION.md`](doc/VDN_ROCM_OPTIMIZATION.md).

HIP weight streaming also reuses thread-safe 8 MiB pinned staging buffers,
avoiding page-lock/unlock for every tensor. Tensors larger than one chunk use
two buffers so the next `pread` overlaps the preceding asynchronous H2D copy;
`H3_HIP_SERIAL_STAGING=1` restores the old serialized transfer loop. Setting
`H3_HIP_STAGING_CACHE=0` restores the old allocation lifecycle and selects the
serialized loop automatically. On the production-token 50-layer forward, the
crossed external wall-time median fell from 37.01 to 35.51 seconds (-4.1%) for
the same 66.818 GiB weight payload, at a cost of about 8 MiB host RSS.
Together with wave32 attention, the same 64x32/56-frame native E2E acceptance
run fell from about 170.7 to 92.66 seconds. After pinned-buffer pipelining and
distributed wave softmax, the latest run completed in 74.71 seconds. Every
acceptance reproduced the exact 73,528-byte MP4 SHA-256 above; isolated crossed
A/B results are used for individual optimization claims.

### Current OpenVDN scope

The validated MVP intentionally keeps a narrow correctness surface:

- `stage-dmd-step-250`, default plus turbo adapters, and exactly 8 NFE are
  validated end to end. `stage-b-step-2000` metadata is validated, but its
  50-NFE output has not completed end-to-end acceptance.
- The VDN path always uses all 50 blocks with `--reuse 1`, `--core-reuse 1`, no
  token reduction, and no int8 row FC2. Unsupported speed combinations fail
  explicitly rather than being silently ignored.
- `--prompt-embeds` is required. Raw `-p` text, `--show` denoising previews,
  first/last frames, and ordered media references are not implemented for VDN.
- One selected ROCm device is used. Eight devices are enumerated, but multi-GPU
  layer sharding remains future work.
- The `gfx1201` wave32 attention path is bitwise-checked against the scalar
  implementation and has completed a 50-layer production-token performance
  run. Large production canvases have not completed visual-quality or full
  VAE/mux acceptance.
- VDN execution is HIP-only. The separate original MiniMax-H3 Metal path and
  its CLI behavior remain available on macOS.

The repository performance ledger is
[`doc/VDN_ROCM_OPTIMIZATION.md`](doc/VDN_ROCM_OPTIMIZATION.md). The broader
workspace implementation and acceptance plan remains in
`../doc/vdn-minimax-h3-implementation-plan.md`.

## MiniMax-H3 Metal tutorial

### 1. Build and inspect the model

The examples assume that the Hugging Face snapshot is in `./MiniMax-H3` and
that FFmpeg and FFprobe are available on `PATH`.

```sh
make -j8
mkdir -p outputs
./h3 --info -d ./MiniMax-H3
```

`--info` checks the model layout and prints the selected Metal device without
mapping all weights or generating media. Run `./h3 --help` for the complete CLI
reference.

Without `-p`, the same binary starts an Iris-style interactive session:

```sh
./h3 -d ./MiniMax-H3 --width 512 --height 512 --steps 6
```

Type a prompt to generate a numbered video. The session keeps the exact BF16
prompt conditioning, prepared DiT, and video decoder in memory, so repeating a
prompt with another seed avoids loading and encoding them again. Useful commands
are `!status`, `!seed random`, `!seconds 2`, `!show`, `!save output.mp4`, and
`!cache`. Use `!help` for the full, short list.

First/last-frame conditioning is persistent in the session:

```text
h3> !first opening.png
h3> !last ending.png
h3> The camera moves slowly around the subject.
```

Use `!first clear` or `!last clear` to remove an anchor. Generated videos are
written to the session directory printed at startup.

For a general Ref2VA conditioning image, use `!ref-image PATH` instead. Images
are appended in order and exposed to the model as `<Picture 1>`, `<Picture 2>`,
and so on; filenames have no meaning to the model.

```text
h3> !ref-image person.png
h3> Make the person shown in Picture 1 wave to the camera.
```

`!refs` lists the current order, `!ref-remove N` removes one entry, and
`!refs clear` removes them all. Ref2VA references cannot be mixed with
`!first`/`!last` anchors.

### 2. Make a first fast video

Start with the validated balanced preset. It generates 22 frames at 24 fps
(about 0.92 seconds), displays the evolving middle-video frame after every
denoising transition in a supported graphical terminal, and prints phase
timings:

```sh
./h3 --profile \
  -d ./MiniMax-H3 \
  -p "A red fox walks through fresh snow in a pine forest. Medium tracking shot, natural winter light, realistic fur, soft footsteps and wind." \
  --width 512 --height 512 \
  --frames 22 --steps 20 \
  --layers 45 --reuse 2 \
  --show \
  -o outputs/fox-fast.mp4
```

This is deliberately not the most aggressive configuration:

- `--steps 20` performs the default 20 denoising passes.
- `--reuse 2` computes 11 fresh denoiser velocities instead of all 20 and
  extrapolates the skipped transitions.
- `--layers 45` runs 45 of the 50 transformer blocks, reducing both time and
  unified-memory use.
- `--show` is optional. It supports Kitty/Ghostty and
  iTerm2/WezTerm/Konsole graphical protocols. It loads a resident preview VAE,
  displays one representative middle-video frame after every Euler transition,
  and then displays all final frames. Display dimensions default to 2x so the
  image has its intended logical size on macOS Retina screens; use `--zoom 1`
  on a non-HiDPI display. This adds preview decode time and roughly 10 GiB of
  temporary model residency; runs without `--show` are unchanged.
- `--profile` is optional and does not select a different generation path.

The first process invocation also pays model loading and filesystem-cache
costs. Compare performance using repeated runs, and alternate variants when
the machines are warming up because this workload is sensitive to thermal
throttling.

For a very short iteration, request four denoising passes directly:

```sh
./h3 --profile \
  -d ./MiniMax-H3 \
  -p "A red fox walks through fresh snow in a pine forest. Medium tracking shot, natural winter light, realistic fur." \
  --width 512 --height 512 --frames 22 \
  --steps 4 --layers 50 --reuse 1 \
  --show \
  -o outputs/fox-four-step.mp4
```

`--steps N` always means exactly N denoising passes. Four through seven passes
use the same schedule that won the low-budget comparison; increasing from 4
to 7 progressively improves detail and motion. Keep `--reuse 1` at such small
budgets so every requested pass runs the model. `--show` displays one preview
after each pass.

Several tail-heavy schedules were evaluated because most visible cleanup
happens late in a long run. They preserved too few early composition updates
and produced woven texture, weak motion, or clipped colors. The retained mode
uses the released linear base grid with one terminal point. On the 512-square,
22-frame fox test, the selected four-pass result had 0.556 full-video SSIM
against a 29-pass reference; an independent surfer test measured 0.547. The
four-pass denoise took about 3.5 seconds on M5 Max, versus 26.4 seconds for the
reference.

For a low-memory run, add `--ssd-streaming`:

```sh
./h3 --profile \
  -d ./MiniMax-H3 \
  -p "A red fox walks through fresh snow in a pine forest." \
  --width 512 --height 512 --frames 22 --steps 20 \
  --layers 50 --reuse 1 --ssd-streaming \
  -o outputs/fox-ssd.mp4
```

This uses the original BF16 checkpoint without conversion or quantization. It
keeps two DiT blocks in memory and reads the next block from SSD while the GPU
runs the current one. On M5 Max, tracked DiT storage fell from about 36.5 GiB to
2.0 GiB at 512 square and 2.1 GiB at 864x480. A warm 50-block forward measured
1.35 versus 2.49 seconds at 512 square (84% slower), and 2.14 versus 2.68
seconds at 864x480 (26% slower). These are comparisons against the same
full-residency BF16 path, and the results were byte-identical in both checks.

The 2.0--2.1 GiB figure is the DiT's tracked tensor storage, not total system
RAM. Prompt encoding and the two VAEs run in separate phases rather than adding
their full peaks to it; the OS, media buffers, and output resolution still need
headroom. `--show` keeps a preview VAE resident and adds roughly 10 GiB, so omit
it for the lowest-memory run.

SSD streaming is an explicit memory/speed tradeoff and is not the default. It
cannot be combined with `--use-int8-row-fc2`. In an interactive session, use
`!ssd-streaming on`.

### 3. Move toward reference quality

Change one control at a time when evaluating quality. First restore all layers,
then all denoiser evaluations, and finally raise the default 20-pass schedule
to the slower 50-pass reference:

```sh
./h3 --profile \
  -d ./MiniMax-H3 \
  -p "A red fox walks through fresh snow in a pine forest. Medium tracking shot, natural winter light, realistic fur, soft footsteps and wind." \
  --width 512 --height 512 \
  --frames 22 --steps 50 \
  --layers 50 --reuse 1 \
  -o outputs/fox-close.mp4
```

The defaults are `--steps 20 --layers 50 --reuse 1`; keep `--steps 50`
explicit for this close path. It performs 50 complete 50-block denoiser
forwards and is much more expensive than the default, but is the right oracle
when a fast mode changes the subject, anatomy, motion, or composition.
Numerical pixel identity with MLX is not expected because the random-number and
execution engines differ; the depicted content and motion should agree.

### 4. Choose a speed/quality preset

These controls are independent unless noted otherwise:

| Control | Slow reference | Default | Aggressive | Main impact |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Denoising passes | `--steps 50` | `--steps 20` | `--steps 4..7` | The number always names actual denoising passes. |
| Whole denoiser reuse | `--reuse 1` | `--reuse 2` | `--reuse 3` | At 20 steps: 20, 11, or 8 fresh DiT evaluations. |
| Active DiT blocks | `--layers 50` | `--layers 45` | `--layers 40` | Fewer blocks reduce compute and resident transformer weights. |
| Core residual reuse | `--core-reuse 1` | `--core-reuse 4` | `--core-reuse 6` | Refreshes patch/head work every step but runs the expensive core less often. |
| Token reduction | off | optional | `--token-reduction` | Pairs horizontal video tokens inside middle blocks; faster but may change composition. |
| Internal canvas | output size | `384x384` for 512 square output | `320x320` | Runs DiT/VAE smaller, then upscales with vImage. |

On M5, `--use-int8-row-fc2` uses one activation scale per FC2 row and a single
full-width TensorOps product. It is optional because it is less numerically
conservative than grouped int8. It reduced complete denoiser forwards by about
2.6% in reciprocal tests. Matched four-step fox and surfer videos kept the same
subjects, setting, and motion (full-video SSIM 0.919 and 0.828). In the
interactive session, use `!int8-row-fc2 on`.

`--reuse` and `--core-reuse` are mutually exclusive. Layer thinning can be
combined with either one.

To make the first command faster while keeping its output resolution, add
token reduction:

```sh
./h3 --profile \
  -d ./MiniMax-H3 \
  -p "A surfer riding inside a sharp blue ocean wave, one rider and one white board, realistic spray." \
  --width 512 --height 512 --frames 22 --steps 20 \
  --layers 45 --reuse 2 --token-reduction \
  -o outputs/surfer-fast.mp4
```

At the validated 512 square shape, token reduction cut the `45 layers + reuse
2` denoise profile from 16.69 to 12.60 seconds on the IT M5 Max. Independent
fox and surfer renders stayed coherent, but composition can diverge more from
the close path.

For an aggressive preview, render internally at 320 square and upscale to the
requested 512 square output:

```sh
./h3 --profile \
  -d ./MiniMax-H3 \
  -p "A red fox walking through snow, realistic, tracking shot." \
  --width 512 --height 512 \
  --render-width 320 --render-height 320 \
  --frames 22 --steps 20 --layers 40 --reuse 3 \
  -o outputs/fox-aggressive.mp4
```

This combination produced a clean, recognizable 22-frame fox in validation,
but loses fine detail and can change framing. Do **not** add `--token-reduction`
to both `--layers 40` and `--reuse 3`: that tested combination produced color
ringing, outlines, and ghosted limbs.

As an alternative to whole-velocity reuse, this keeps the timestep-dependent
patch and output heads fresh at every transition:

```sh
./h3 --profile \
  -d ./MiniMax-H3 \
  -p "A surfer riding a blue ocean wave." \
  --width 512 --height 512 --frames 22 --steps 20 \
  --layers 45 --core-reuse 4 \
  -o outputs/surfer-core-reuse.mp4
```

Use `--core-reuse 6` only as an aggressive preview. Values above 6 are not
exposed because validation lost subject fidelity.

### 5. Pick resolution and duration

Width and height must each be multiples of 32, at least 32, and their product
must not exceed `768 * 1344` pixels. Those are mechanical limits, not a promise
that every tiny canvas has good model quality. H3-Base is a 768p model.

| Canvas | Current guidance |
|---|---|
| `512x512` | Safest development size; repeatedly validated with multiple prompts. |
| `768x768` | Validated close-quality square output; substantially more expensive. |
| `1344x768`, `768x1344` | Released 768p-class landscape/portrait limit. |
| `1024x768`, `768x1024` | Valid 4:3 and 3:4 768p-class canvases. |
| `384x384` internal to `512x512` | Validated fast-quality scaling point. |
| `320x320` internal to `512x512` | Validated aggressive scaling point. |
| `256x256` | Native fast-preview canvas with automatic low-resolution RoPE adaptation. |

For a fast native 256-square preview:

```sh
./h3 -d ./MiniMax-H3 \
  -p "A red fox walks through fresh snow in a pine forest." \
  --width 256 --height 256 \
  --frames 22 --steps 20 \
  --layers 50 --reuse 1 \
  -o outputs/fox-256.mp4
```

At 256 square, H3 has only an `8x8` effective spatial-token grid, so it has less
room for fine detail and complex composition. H3 automatically halves spatial
RoPE coordinates at exactly 256 square. This removed repeating lattice
artifacts in long fox renders and stayed coherent on an independent portrait,
without adding tokens or runtime. Use `--use-reference-rope` to restore the
released/MLX coordinates for parity checks. Keep token reduction off at this
size. Native 128 square remains unsupported: its `4x4` token grid did not
recover a recognizable subject even with adjusted RoPE.

`--render-width` and `--render-height` must be set together, must have the same
aspect ratio as the output, and cannot exceed the output dimensions. The model
and VAE use the internal size; terminal frames and the encoded video retain the
requested output size.

H3 emits 24 fps and aligns frame requests upward to `5 + 17*n`:

Use `--seconds N` for a duration-oriented request, or `--frames N` for direct
frame control; the two options are mutually exclusive. Fractional seconds are
accepted. Seconds are converted at 24 fps and then rounded upward to the next
legal H3 temporal shape, so `--seconds 10` produces 243 frames (10.125 seconds).

| Frames | Approximate video duration |
|---:|---:|
| 22 | 0.917 seconds |
| 39 | 1.625 seconds |
| 56 | 2.333 seconds |
| 107 | 4.458 seconds |
| 243 | 10.125 seconds |
| 362 | 15.083 seconds |

Short clips are useful for development. The released workflow is intended for
roughly 4–15 second videos. A request such as `--frames 23` is rounded up to 39
frames rather than producing an arbitrary temporal shape.

### 6. Improve the prompt

A short prompt works, but the released system expects a Context-IR-like
description. State the subject, action, setting, camera, lighting/style, and
desired sound. For example:

```text
Scene: a single red fox in a snow-covered pine forest at dawn.
Action: the fox walks steadily left to right and looks toward the camera once.
Camera: medium-height lateral tracking shot, 50 mm lens, stable framing.
Look: photorealistic fur, cold blue ambient light, warm sunrise rim light.
Audio: soft footsteps in snow, light wind through pine branches, no music.
```

Keep identity and object counts explicit when they matter. `--seed N` controls
the native random stream; the default is 42. Compare options with the same
prompt, seed, resolution, frame count, and step count.

### 7. Preview frames and diagnose performance

- `--show` displays a representative frame after every denoising transition,
  followed by all frames from the completed video. Like Iris, it advertises 2x
  display dimensions by default for Retina terminals; `--zoom N` changes that
  factor without resizing the generated video or the encoded terminal image.
- `--frames-dir DIR` writes final callback frames as PPM files. Intermediate
  `--show` previews are not written there.
- `-o ''` disables MP4 encoding; combine it with `--frames-dir` when FFmpeg is
  unavailable.
- `--profile` reports phase wall time, backend encoding/wait time, peak live
  tensor storage, cumulative allocation, and dispatch counts. HIP additionally
  reports weight I/O throughput and event-timed operation classes.

For example:

```sh
./h3 --profile -d ./MiniMax-H3 -p "A hummingbird hovering over red flowers." \
  --width 512 --height 512 --frames 22 --steps 20 \
  --layers 45 --reuse 2 --frames-dir outputs/hummingbird-frames \
  -o ''
```

### 8. Add image, video, and audio references

First/last-frame anchors select the FL2VA path:

```sh
./h3 -d ./MiniMax-H3 -p "The fox keeps walking through the snow." \
  --width 512 --height 512 --frames 22 --steps 20 \
  --layers 45 --reuse 2 \
  --first-frame fox.png --last-frame fox-later.png \
  -o outputs/fox-anchored.mp4
```

Ordered references select the distinct Ref2VA checkpoint. Use the flag matching
the media semantics:

```sh
# One image reference.
./h3 -d ./MiniMax-H3 -p "Use the animal and setting in the reference." \
  --width 512 --height 512 --frames 22 --steps 20 \
  --ref-image fox.png -o outputs/fox-reference.mp4

# Continue a clip but ignore its soundtrack.
./h3 -d ./MiniMax-H3 -p "Continue the motion in this clip." \
  --width 512 --height 512 --frames 22 --steps 20 \
  --ref-silent-video fox.mp4 -o outputs/fox-video-reference.mp4

# Preserve the clip's embedded audio.
./h3 -d ./MiniMax-H3 -p "Continue this audiovisual scene." \
  --width 512 --height 512 --frames 56 --steps 20 \
  --ref-video fox-with-audio.mp4 -o outputs/fox-video-audio.mp4

# Replace a video's soundtrack explicitly.
./h3 -d ./MiniMax-H3 -p "Continue the scene with the supplied music." \
  --width 512 --height 512 --frames 56 --steps 20 \
  --ref-video-audio silent-fox.mp4 replacement.wav \
  -o outputs/fox-replaced-audio.mp4

# An ordered image plus standalone audio reference.
./h3 -d ./MiniMax-H3 -p "Use the animal and music from the references." \
  --width 512 --height 512 --frames 56 --steps 20 \
  --ref-image fox.png --ref-audio music.wav \
  -o outputs/fox-image-audio.mp4
```

Reference flags may be repeated and their command-line order is preserved.
Standalone audio must accompany an image or video reference. Audio references
must be 2–15 seconds; at most three audio inputs are accepted and their total
decoded duration is capped at 15 seconds.

## Tests and runtime requirements

### Apple Metal

```sh
make test
make parity
```

`make test` runs the deterministic host suite and, when the ignored MLX fixture
is installed under `misc/fixtures/`, compiles the Metal source at runtime and
checks a complete toy H3 block against named MLX outputs. Runtime compilation is
intentional: it follows Iris and does not require Xcode's optional offline Metal
toolchain. The test covers both an F32 diagnosis path and the production BF16
storage path; wide BF16 matrix products and SDPA use cached MPSGraph graphs, with
direct Metal correctness fallbacks. `make parity` runs only those Metal/MLX
checks.

### Linux HIP and OpenVDN

Build and run the deterministic host, backend, and operator suites with:

```sh
make BACKEND=hip -j16
make BACKEND=hip h3_tests
./h3_tests
make BACKEND=hip \
  backend-test gpu-storage-test gpu-ops-test gpu-dit-ops-test json-test \
  vdn-metadata-test vdn-reference-test vdn-block-loader-test \
  vdn-prompt-test vdn-gpu-ops-test
```

The real-weight tests are intentionally split so loader, refiner, block stack,
complete forward, scheduler, and VAE failures remain attributable:

```sh
make BACKEND=hip vdn-refiner-smoke-test
make BACKEND=hip vdn-block-smoke-test
make BACKEND=hip vdn-stack-smoke-test
make BACKEND=hip vdn-forward-smoke-test
make BACKEND=hip vdn-denoise-smoke-test
make BACKEND=hip vdn-video-vae-smoke-test
make BACKEND=hip vdn-audio-vae-smoke-test
make BACKEND=hip vdn-e2e-test
```

These targets expect the pinned snapshot at `models/vdn-minimax-h3` and the
converted `prompts/example_0.safetensors`. `vdn-e2e-test` injects the
project-local FFmpeg library path itself and writes
`outputs/vdn-e2e-smoke.mp4`. The full denoise test performs 400 real transformer
block evaluations and is not a quick unit test.

`make BACKEND=hip h3_vdn_sdpa_bench` builds the standalone window-attention
benchmark. Its default arguments model the 512x512/56-frame VDN geometry;
`H3_VDN_SCALAR_SDPA=1 ./h3_vdn_sdpa_bench` runs the scalar oracle. For
same-binary comparisons, `H3_VDN_RELOAD_QUERY=1` reloads query values inside
the key loop and `H3_VDN_SCAN_MASK=1` scans masked rows instead of jumping over
the two disallowed gaps.

FFmpeg and FFprobe must be available on `PATH` for media inputs and MP4 output
(`H3_FFMPEG` and `H3_FFPROBE` may select explicit executables). Generated RGB24 and
32 kHz stereo F32 PCM are fed through concurrent pipes; no intermediate
uncompressed media file is created.

## Implementation and performance notes

The remainder documents the implementation behind the tutorial presets and the
environment variables retained for exact A/B diagnosis.

### Sampler and DiT controls

The default sampler uses the released shifted video/audio schedule. `--steps`
always names the number of denoising passes, with terminal zero added after the
last pass. Whole-denoiser reuse evaluates the first and last pass plus every
requested interval, then extrapolates skipped video and audio velocities on
their independent schedules. With very small step counts, keep `--reuse 1`.

For the low-budget path, the released linear base grid won against
actual-video-sigma linear spacing,
quadratic and cubic warps, exact 30-point tail subsets, mild power warps,
zero-order held full-grid velocities, linear velocity extrapolation, and RES.
The more tail-heavy candidates often sharpened the subject but damaged motion
or left a repetitive woven background; sparse RES and long extrapolation
intervals failed much more visibly.

Layer thinning ranks the checkpoint's actual AdaLN gates while protecting
structurally important first and final blocks. Unused weights and schedule
tensors are not retained, so `--layers 45` and `--layers 40` reduce both
transformer time and unified-memory use. Core reuse holds the previous full
transformer residual while refreshing the patch projection and timestep-aware
head; it remains mutually exclusive with whole-velocity reuse.

### Exact DiT fusions

Every active DiT block fuses its attention residual gate with the following MLP
AdaLN. The rounded BF16 residual is still written exactly, but the same row is
kept in threadgroup memory for normalization, eliminating one dispatch and one
global reread. Away from token-reduction boundaries, the MLP residual gate also
produces the next block's attention AdaLN and carries that normalized state
across the loop. `H3_DISABLE_FUSED_GATE_ADALN=1` and
`H3_DISABLE_FUSED_CROSS_BLOCK_ADALN=1` restore the two-kernel oracles.
The final audio/video AdaLN kernels bind directly to offsets in the residual
stream, avoiding two slice blits and 18.8 MiB of scratch at 512x512 (29.4 MiB
at the 864-class benchmark shape).
`H3_DISABLE_FUSED_FINAL_SLICE=1` restores the copy-plus-AdaLN oracle at load.
The BF16 final heads then apply AdaLN while loading their 16x16 projection
tiles, preserving the standalone rounding and accumulation order while
removing another equally sized normalized activation. The two optimizations
together save 37.5/58.9 MiB. `H3_DISABLE_FUSED_FINAL_HEAD=1` restores the
offset-AdaLN-plus-linear oracle at load.

### Token-reduction internals

`--token-reduction` is an independent aggressive DiT mode. After block 3 it
pairs adjacent horizontal target-video tokens while leaving text, audio,
conditions, and reference tokens exact. The complete full-resolution state is
kept as a bypass. During the first ten noisy evaluations it restores before
block 40; subsequent detail-forming evaluations restore before block 30. Each
token returns as its original value plus the update learned by its pair, so
within-pair detail is not discarded.
The pooling kernel writes only true-pair baselines into a dense tail of the
already allocated attention scratch buffer; odd-width singleton tokens need no
baseline. The full bypass uses the oversized QKV tail when it fits, with a
guarded dedicated fallback only for reference-heavy layouts. Common text-only
canvases therefore add no activation arena at any token-grid width. Pooling
also snapshots both source tokens while their BF16 values are already in
registers, avoiding a separate full-hidden blit and redundant source read. The
same entry kernel keeps each pooled row in threadgroup memory and emits the
first reduced block's attention AdaLN, eliminating another global residual read.
At the restore boundary, the first full-resolution attention AdaLN is fused
into expansion: a 10.5 KiB threadgroup row avoids a global residual reread while
still writing the exact bypass needed by the following residual branch.
On a thermal-balanced 512x512x22, 19-forward IT M5 Max A/B this reduced denoise
time from 39.13 to 28.06 seconds (28.3%). Final video/audio latent relative L2
was 5.56%/15.14%. First/middle/last fox frames retained one clean muzzle,
coherent legs, and sharp fur; an independent surfer remained consistent with
one rider and board through the wave spray. It changes composition and is
therefore opt-in rather than the close-reference default.
`H3_TOKEN_REDUCTION_BLOCKS` can override the later `4:30` interval;
`H3_TOKEN_REDUCTION_EARLY=STEPS:END` overrides the early schedule and `0`
disables it. `H3_DISABLE_TOKEN_REDUCTION=1` provides an in-context exact oracle.
`H3_DISABLE_FUSED_TOKEN_POOL_ADALN=1` and
`H3_DISABLE_FUSED_TOKEN_ADALN=1` independently restore the two-kernel entry and
exit boundaries for diagnosis.
Token reduction composes cleanly with the validated `--layers 45 --reuse 2`
settings: on the same 512 benchmark it reduced that profile from 16.69 to
12.60 seconds (24.5% marginal), and independent fox and surfer renders stayed
coherent. Do not combine it with both `--layers 40` and `--reuse 3`; that
6.47-second experiment produced chromatic ringing and ghosted limbs despite
acceptable latent norms.

### Internal canvas and video VAE

`--render-width` and `--render-height` run the model and VAE on a lower
same-aspect internal canvas, then high-quality vImage-scale RGB frames to the
requested output size before callbacks, terminal display, and encoding. This is an
explicit quality/speed tradeoff: a measured 384-to-512 prompt render reduced
M5 DiT time by 33% and video-VAE time by 18% while retaining a clean,
recognizable photorealistic result. Both values must be multiples of 32; the
exact output canvas remains the default.
For square 512 output, 384 is the fast-quality point and 320 is the validated
aggressive point. The latter produced a coherent walking fox and repeated at
8.02 seconds of DiT versus about 15.82 seconds natively. Native 256 uses the
same-cost spatial-RoPE adaptation described above; it remains a fast composition
preview rather than a substitute for a 512- or 768-class final render.
The video VAE automatically chooses a 256-320 pixel spatial tile from the
requested canvas geometry, minimizing repeated overlap work while keeping peak
storage bounded. `H3_VAE_TILE_PIXELS=256` restores the original conservative
tile plan for close-reference diagnosis.

### Weight residency and streamed prompt encoding

On M5-class GPUs, persistent transformer weights are mapped directly from their
safetensor shards instead of copied into anonymous shared buffers. This keeps
the 37 GiB model file-backed/reclaimable and slightly improves total transformer
time; M3 uses the faster copied-buffer path. `H3_ZERO_COPY_WEIGHTS=0` disables
the M5 selection for diagnostics.
The streamed Qwen text encoder preallocates a small ring of future layer
buffers and fills them on eight I/O workers while Metal executes the current
layer. The default ring depth is two layers on M3/older hardware and three on
M5, where the target machine has 128 GiB. `H3_QWEN_PREFETCH=0` restores the
single-layer synchronous reference path; values 1-8 select the worker count,
and `H3_QWEN_PREFETCH_DEPTH=1` through `6` overrides the ring depth.

`--ssd-streaming` is a separate, more aggressive residency mode for the DiT.
Only its small per-block normalization weights remain resident. Two complete
BF16 matrix slots alternate while a background reader fills the next slot in
checkpoint-offset order; the current Metal command buffer runs concurrently.
Darwin uncached reads avoid retaining a second copy in the filesystem cache.
The first active block is prefetched again during the final block, so a cached
interactive DiT is ready for its next denoiser evaluation. Measurements reached
about 13--14.6 GiB/s from the internal SSD. `H3_PROFILE=1` reports total bytes,
read throughput, and the part of the read wait that was not hidden by GPU work.

### Metal 4 and TensorOps paths

M5 GPUs automatically use native BF16 Metal 4/TensorOps for the DiT QKV and
attention-output projections at sequence lengths up to 2,048. The compact
Morton schedule routes Q/K/V directly into head-major attention inputs, avoids
three MPSGraph input transposes, and is byte-identical to the portable path. It
improves a complete 512x512 50-block forward by about 2% across repeated IT/US
M5 Max runs. For 2,049-3,072 rows, including 864x480, two row-offset Morton
dispatches preserve the efficient tile geometry and improve the complete
forward by about 2% in balanced runs. Still larger sequences stay on MPSGraph.
`H3_NAX=0` disables TensorOps for exact A/B diagnosis. The selection is guarded
at runtime and falls back to the unchanged portable library if compilation is
unavailable.

`H3_NAX=1` forces the broader native BF16 linear path. It passes the complete
50-block MLX fixture, but remains opt-in: exact-shape microbenchmarks favor its
128-row tile while full DiT runs currently favor MPSGraph scheduling. This
keeps a working NAX integration available for later quantized/fused kernels
without making a benchmark regression the default.
`H3_NAX=mlp` selects a more specialized Metal 4 path: paired FC1 gate/up
TensorOps tiles apply SwiGLU in threadgroup memory and write only the
14,336-wide activated intermediate, then FC2 also stays on TensorOps.
`H3_DISABLE_NAX_MLP=1` keeps the MPSGraph MLP in a context created this way for
same-process A/B testing. The path is deliberately opt-in because scheduling
depends on the OS GPU stack: the primary macOS 26.5.2 M5 Max gained 1.3-2.0%
in isolated real-weight MLP runs but lost about 1-3% in a complete 50-block forward,
while an otherwise identical macOS 26.5 M5 Max gained 1.4% in a same-context
forward A/B. The resulting 50-block velocities were close (1.9% video and 2.4%
audio relative L2), but not byte-identical.

### Specialized projection kernels

The narrow DiT audio/video output heads convert their small released F32
weights to BF16 once and use the Iris-derived 16x16 tiled linear directly on
BF16 activations. At the production 320-render geometry, isolated paired-head
measurements are 2.30x faster on M3 Max and 1.83x faster on M5 Max, with
relative L2 `8.64e-4`; the absolute M5 saving is about 0.6 ms per evaluated
step. Full fox and surfer sequences remained clean and measured 29.9/38.4 dB
against the F32-head renders. `H3_DIT_F32_FINAL=1` restores the close-reference
head and its extra activation buffers.
The F32 `96->5376` video and `32->5376` audio patch projections use a dedicated
16x16 cooperative tile, retaining F32 weights, inputs and accumulation while
rounding the tile result directly to BF16.
Paired production-shape measurements are 1.77x faster on M3 and 1.62-1.78x
on M5; the complete generated RGB stream is byte-identical to the scalar path.
Fusing the final cast improves the 2835-row tile itself from 2.499 to 1.734 ms
on M3 and 1.555 to 1.186 ms on M5, and removes 38.27/59.66 MiB of F32 scratch
at 512/864-class geometry. `H3_DISABLE_FUSED_PATCH_CAST=1` restores the tiled
F32 output plus standalone cast; `H3_SCALAR_PATCH=1` selects the scalar
diagnostic path.
The same tile binds its output directly into the packed hidden stream, removing
the BF16 media staging buffers and their blits. This saves another 19.13/29.83
MiB and improves the 2835-row boundary from 1.847 to 1.730 ms on M3 and 1.282
to 1.184 ms on M5. Contiguous T2VA uses byte offsets; FL2VA/Ref2VA use compact
destination-row maps so each modality remains one large dispatch. A complete
six-segment Ref2VA M5 ABBA remained byte-identical and improved 5.067 to 5.033
seconds per measured forward pair. `H3_DISABLE_FUSED_PATCH_PACK=1` restores the
staging buffers and packing blits.

### Scheduling and activation memory

The DiT core is split into two ordered Metal command buffers so GPU execution
of the first part overlaps CPU encoding of the second. Thermal-balanced ABBA
measurements select a 60%-depth split on M5 (30/50, 27/45, and 24/40), with
roughly 0.5-1.8% wins; M3 automatically splits only the validated 30/50 case,
which measured 1.2% faster, because 24/40 regressed there. The operation order
and generated bytes are unchanged. `H3_DIT_COMMAND_BLOCKS=0` restores one
command buffer; values 1-50 override the split for further tuning.
DiT activation buffers also follow their actual intra-block lifetimes: the QKV
projection arena is reused first for attention heads and then for the normalized
MLP input, while the current attention-output arena becomes the MLP output after
its branch has been consumed. This removes 61.25 MiB at 512-class geometry and
99.63 MiB at 864-class geometry without changing dispatches or arithmetic.
`H3_DISABLE_DIT_ACTIVATION_ALIAS=1` restores separate diagnostic buffers.
MPSGraph tensor-data wrappers for immutable DiT weights and biases are retained
with their resident buffers. This avoids rebuilding the same binding metadata
for every block and denoiser evaluation without copying tensor storage; measured
ABBA gains were 1.6% on M3 Max and 0.4-1.1% on M5 Max. Activation wrappers stay
transient because retaining them regressed the M5. The outputs remain
byte-identical, and `H3_DISABLE_GRAPH_DATA_CACHE=1` restores transient wrappers
for all tensors.
On M3/older hardware, the four MPSGraph segments in each DiT block also reuse
one `MPSCommandBuffer` wrapper for their shared underlying Metal command buffer.
Repeated thermal-balanced runs measured 1.0-1.6% faster on M3 Max; M5 measured
neutral, so it retains fresh wrappers. `H3_REUSE_MPS_COMMAND=0` or `1` overrides
the automatic selection. Results are byte-identical.
On M5, the serving Euler sampler keeps its patch-packed F32 latents and cached
BF16 velocities in Metal buffers. Each selected denoiser refresh is completed
before the next is encoded, avoiding MPSGraph back-pressure while removing all
intermediate latent/velocity readbacks and repacking. Two warm eight-run A/B
sequences measured small 0.1% and 0.3% gains with byte-identical final latents;
the path also saves roughly 16 bytes of transient host state per video-latent
element (about 136 MB at the 768p shape). M3 and older GPUs retain the CPU
sampler by default. `H3_CPU_SAMPLER=1` restores it on M5;
`H3_GPU_SAMPLER=1` selects the GPU-state path explicitly, and
`H3_GPU_SAMPLER_WINDOW=0` enables the slower unbounded encode-ahead diagnostic.

### Checkpoint layout and media pipeline

The released checkpoint stores DiT QKV rows interleaved per attention head.
Native Metal consumes that layout directly in the fused QK-normalization/RoPE
kernel, avoiding a checkpoint transpose and extra RAM. The earlier identity
interpretation was the cause of the noisy diagnostic outputs.

The public generation path decodes the joint audio latent with a streamed native
BigVGAN/AudioVAE and writes synchronized H.264 plus 32 kHz stereo AAC. The native
waveform agrees with the corrected MLX oracle to relative L2 `6.94e-5`.
`--first-frame`, `--last-frame`, and their combination use the released visual
VAE encoder, Qwen3-VL vision tower and three-deepstack multimodal presentation,
0.999 condition augmentation, and fixed condition rows in the native DiT. The
first image is stretched to the target canvas; the last image is aspect-cover
scaled and center cropped, matching the reference implementation. `--ref-image`
selects the distinct Ref2VA transformer, preserves ordered `<Picture N>`
presentation, and uses the released down-only aspect-preserving reference canvas.
`--ref-silent-video` additionally performs bounded 24 fps decoding, the visual
VAE's causal `ceil(T/4)` compression, two-frame Qwen sampling, and timestamped
`<Video N>` presentation. `--ref-video` preserves an embedded soundtrack,
`--ref-video-audio VIDEO AUDIO` supplies an explicit replacement, and
`--ref-audio` appends an ordered standalone clip. Reference audio is decoded as
32 kHz stereo F32, encoded by the native AudioVAE posterior-mean path, mixed as
0.999 clean latent plus 0.001 seeded noise, pinned to the audio condition
timestep 1.0, and packed as width-32 rows on the same rotary timeline as visual
references. Audio inputs are 2-15 seconds, at most three are
accepted, their total decoded duration is capped at 15 seconds, and a standalone
audio reference must be combined with an image or video reference.

The native audio encoder matches the corrected MLX oracle at relative L2
`3.59e-6` on a real two-second stereo fixture. The correction is important: the
original MLX reshape interleaved left/right samples, whereas the official
PyTorch/SGLang path folds intact stereo channels into the batch dimension. On
the 128 GB M5 Max, clean end-to-end image+audio and embedded-video+audio renders
completed in 74.58 and 76.99 seconds respectively, each with about a 40.1 GB
peak physical footprint and zero swaps.

### Profiling and diagnostic paths

`--profile` reports each Metal-backed phase separately: wall time, CPU-side
command encoding, complete commit-to-fence wait, root-command GPU timestamps,
peak live tensor storage, cumulative allocation, and dispatch counts. The wait
measurement is the complete command turnaround; the root GPU timestamp alone
can omit child buffers scheduled internally by MPSGraph and is labeled
accordingly.

The DiT fast path evaluates each BF16 `fc1 -> SwiGLU -> fc2` block as one cached
graph, avoiding separate graph boundaries and persistent intermediate tensors.
Set `H3_DISABLE_FUSED_MLP=1` to retain the close-reference operation boundaries
for numerical diagnosis.

On supported M5 Metal 4 TensorOps hardware, the native int8 MLP engine is the
default. It dynamically quantizes activations, uses per-output-channel weight
scales, and gives the sensitive FC2 input one scale per 1,024 channels.
The selected FC2 kernel keeps scaled partial products in private cooperative
fragments instead of repeatedly spilling a 32 KiB threadgroup tile. A fixed
50-layer, 19-transition 512x512 render measured 36.30 seconds with BF16 MPS and
25.80 seconds with int8 on M5 Max. Beginning, middle, and final decoded frames
retained the same subject, composition, and motion; small edge and fur details
can differ. The current diagnostic implementation retains both BF16 and int8
MLP weights only when an A/B diagnostic requests them. Normal int8 loading
releases each block's BF16 FC1/FC2 buffers after their submitted quantization
finishes, reducing measured peak tensor storage to 25.9 GiB from the BF16
path's 36.4 GiB. Runtime weight quantization still adds startup time.

The fastest M5 path also quantizes each DiT QKV projection and writes its
Q/K/V tiles directly in head-major attention layout before the existing Q/K
normalization and RoPE kernel. In a fixed 50-layer, 19-transition 512x512
render this reduced denoising again, from 25.80 to 19.32 seconds. Sampled
beginning, middle, and final frames remained a coherent detailed fox walking
through snow; quantized attention can change framing and fine detail. Use
`--use-slower-bf16-qkv` for the close-reference BF16 projection. Normal int8
loading releases the redundant BF16 QKV weights after quantization.

The following attention-output projection is int8 as well on the default M5
path. Crossed same-model tests improve a complete forward by another 4.5-5.5%
at 512 and 864. A decoded fox render remained clean and closely matched the
int8-QKV-only composition; its thermally hot denoise measured 19.18 seconds.
Use `--use-slower-bf16-attention-output` to retain that projection in BF16.

On that int8 path, SDPA now leaves its result in native
`[head,row,dimension]` order. A specialized 256-thread kernel gathers and
quantizes each H3 row directly into the projection's row-major int8 buffer,
eliminating the intervening full-width BF16 transpose without changing any
output byte. Thermally controlled crossed runs improve complete 512 and 864
forwards by roughly 0.2-1.2%. Use
`--use-slower-row-major-attention-output` to restore the explicit BF16
row-major SDPA output and ordinary quantizer.

The M5 path also folds QKV and MLP activation quantization into the preceding
gated AdaLN kernel. This removes 99 standalone quantizer dispatches per
50-layer forward while preserving the previous output bytes, improving crossed
512/864 measurements by about 0.3-0.6%. Use
`--use-slower-unfused-int8-inputs` to restore the standalone quantizers.

The fused gated-AdaLN path loads its full 5,376-wide H3 rows as BF16x4 vectors
and writes int8x4. It stages the rounded values locally before computing the
original per-thread RMS sequence, so the reduction tree and every output byte
remain unchanged. Crossed measurements save roughly another 0.1-0.5%. The
existing `--use-slower-unfused-int8-inputs` option retains the portable scalar
and standalone-quantizer fallback.

Q/K RMS normalization and RoPE are performed inside the int8 QKV projection
tile as well. The fused epilogue is byte-identical and improves complete
forwards by 2.1-3.2% at 512 and 1.0-1.8% at 864 in crossed M5 measurements.
Use `--use-slower-unfused-qkv-rope` to restore the separate Q/K kernel.

That epilogue processes four adjacent Q/K dimensions per work item with
BF16x4 loads and stores. The per-element arithmetic and BF16 rounding order are
unchanged, while crossed cool-state measurements improve complete forwards by
about 0.4-1.0% at both 512 and 864. The same
`--use-slower-unfused-qkv-rope` option restores the scalar standalone path.

At up to 2,048 rows, the exact RMS loop uses BF16x4 loads followed by four
explicit ordered FMAs. This preserves every output bit and improves 512-class
forwards by another 0.5-0.6%; larger shapes retain scalar loads because the two
forms tie there. Use `--use-slower-scalar-qkv-rms` to force scalar loads.

The int8 attention-output projection caches its 128 row and column scales in
1 KiB of threadgroup memory instead of rereading them for every cooperative
fragment element. Above 2,048 rows the fused QKV kernel uses the same idea and
then recycles that storage for inverse RMS values; smaller QKV shapes retain
direct loads because the two forms tie there. Both are byte-identical and
improve complete forwards by about 0.2-0.7% where selected. Use
`--use-slower-uncached-int8-scales` to restore direct device-scale loads.

For sequences of at most 2,048 rows, the H3 attention-output projection also
compiles its 7,168-by-5,376 shape into the TensorOps kernel. The result remains
byte-identical while saving about 0.2-0.8% in crossed complete 512-forward
measurements. Larger sequences retain the dynamic-shape kernel because the
specialization regresses there. `--use-slower-uncached-int8-scales` restores
the general dynamic, direct-scale-load implementation.

FC1 also uses an H3-specialized, compile-time 5,376-wide TensorOps loop. It is
byte-identical to the generic loop and saves about 0.1-0.4% in crossed complete
forwards. Use `--use-slower-dynamic-fc1-k` to restore the runtime-bound loop.

```sh
./h3 --profile -d ./MiniMax-H3 \
  -p "A red fox walks through fresh snow." \
  --width 512 --height 512 --frames 22 --steps 20 \
  --layers 50 --reuse 1 -o outputs/fox-int8.mp4
```

Use `--use-slower-bf16-mlp` to force the portable close-reference MPS/BF16 MLP
path for numerical comparison. Older Metal hardware selects that path
automatically when the required native TensorOps kernels are unavailable.
For FC2 activation quantization, sequences of at most 2,048 rows use an exact
128-thread reduction. Each thread retains its eight BF16 input values while
computing the group maximum, avoiding a second device-memory read when it emits
the int8 values; crossed M5 measurements improved complete 512 forwards by
about 0.2-0.8% without changing any output byte. Larger sequences retain the
measured 256-thread kernel. `--use-slower-grouped-quantizer` forces the latter
at every size for A/B comparison.

The native baseline targets the original `FL2VA/` and `Ref2VA/` checkpoint
trees. Model phases are loaded and released separately so the 33B transformer,
Qwen encoder, and decoders never have to coexist in unified memory.
